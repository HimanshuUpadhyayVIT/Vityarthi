\# Problem Statement

People experiencing symptoms often face uncertainty about what disease
or condition they may have. Without medical knowledge, identifying
diseases based on symptoms can be confusing and lead to delayed or
inappropriate treatment. There is a need for a simple tool that provides
potential disease identification based on input symptoms to aid early
awareness and guide users toward professional consultation.

\# Scope of the Project

This project aims to develop a basic symptom checker Python program that
matches user-provided symptoms against predefined disease-symptom rules.
It identifies possible diseases when all key symptoms match but does not
replace professional medical diagnosis. The system is rule-based,
supports a limited disease database, and runs on the command line.

\# Target Users

\- General public seeking quick, preliminary symptom assessment.

\- Students or beginners learning programming concepts in Python and
simple rule-based systems.

\- Healthcare educators demonstrating symptom-disease mapping basics.

\# High-Level Features

\- Accepts multiple symptoms entered as comma-separated input from
users.

\- Converts and cleans input for case-insensitive matching.

\- Matches input symptoms against predefined rule sets for several
diseases.

\- Returns the name of a possible disease if all defining symptoms are
present.

\- Provides a default message encouraging consultation with a doctor if
no match is found.

\- Simple, interactive command-line interface for ease of use.
